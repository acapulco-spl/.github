# aCaPulCO -- efficient optimal configuration of software product lines

This organisation contains the aCaPulCO tool, which uses consistency-preserving configuration operators, generated specifically for a given feature model, to ensure that no invalid configurations are ever created during the search for optimal configurations. This allows multi-objective, search-based optimisation to find better configurations more efficiently than the previous state of the art.

## Repositories

1. [`acapulco`](https://github.com/acapulco-spl/acapulco) contains the aCaPulCO tool packaged as a set of Eclipse plugins ready for installation and use. This tool, its use and extensibility have been described in [2].
2. [`acapulco_replication_package`](https://github.com/acapulco-spl/acapulco_replication_package) contains the replication package for the experiments in the original TSE paper [1].
